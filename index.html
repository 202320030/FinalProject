                                <p>Bloodborne is a game that features dark and gothic architecture, which immediately gives the player a sense of hopelessness once they set sights on the initial area. The player themselves,
                                    must set out to find any clues about the lore on their own as the game focuses on the main story and not a whole lot for side stories, both minor and major characters, and events behind the lore to the
                                    point that even weapons, clothes, and items have lore attached to them. The basic controls are taught to the player initially while some advanced moves and tricks relies on the player to find out how it works. <br><br>Gameplay maybe a challange to beginners to BloodBorne as the
                                    flow of the game is reliant on dodgin, and fast-paced, risk taking combat. While this may be a daunting challenge, the game features a system called "rally system" which works when a player was hit, an orange bar
                                    appears in the health bar, this prompts the player to play more risky as it gives back health for every hit to an enemy in the timespan that it is available. The design of the enemy units fits every
                                    location that they are placed in, and some location features hazards that make it hard for the player to pass through. As for the bosses, they are similar to the enemies as they are placed in the area
                                    with purpose, every boss feels unique from the previous ones and they rarely feel boring and repetitive. <br><br> the game is definitely entertaining for gamers that like this kind of games but casual games may
                                    find that the game is reliant on dodging enemy attacks.</p>

                                <p>If you are familiar with the original doom, then you may find this one to be different. But Doom eternal is an arcade game at heart. The graphics are great for that it finds a sweet spot between amazing and highly detailed, and
                                  enough that the game wouldn't need a system so needy for expensive GPUs. Combat feels just as fast, if not faster than the previous installment from 2016, the introduction of a dash makes the game even faster and chaotic which
                                  feeds in to the theme of the game. The newer enemies look even more demonic and intimidating than before, some are larger, faster, annoying, and deal even more damage. The music makes you feel that you really are ripping and tearing
                                  demons left and right, jumping from one to another as soon as u tear them in half. Each level features large rooms filled with enemies, making the player use the environment to their advantage with portals, steel beams and ledges.
                                  to try and outmanuever the demons. There isn't much focus for story other than the main missions, making the player focus on primarily combat, but it is still a great story. There's a lot of lore in things like codexes and audiobites from 
                                  important characters like the Dark Lord, samuel hayden and others.<br><br> The game is definitely worth it when you are look for something to pass the time while enjoying the chaos, challange and gore that the game brings to the table.

                                <p>if you are looking for a turn-based strategy game without the fear of needing to completely understand and master the game while having challenges all on it's own, then look no further than Civilization VI. Civ 6 is a turn-based strategy
                                  game where it starts off from the ancient era to the future era with your chosen civilization, may it be the early Babylonians with the great gilgamesh, or teddy Roosevelt with his rough riders. as you travel through
                                  history, you may learn a bit or two of the world wonders that you can build and give you an advantage. the gameplay may feel overwhelming at first it will require you to immediately manage your starting city to compete with the other "civs". it does feel forgiving towards players who are new to the genre due to the fact that the A.I. may or may not ally themselves with the player.
                                  the game may feel a bit easy once you get a heading with your civ in the later "eras". The base game does feel a bit boring after a while and the game does have DLCs where the gameplay is enhanced with the newer elements added with the DLC.
                                  <br><br>Overall, the game is great for casual gameplay and good use of your time. Just watch out for the "last turn syndrome" as you won't notice that the time passed after you planned to save and quit.

                                <p>if you are an avid fan of the soulsborne games, a fan of giant open world set for you to explore, then elden ring gives to a bit of both. Elden ring builds open the combat system of mainly dark souls, it is better at the fact that elden ring gives more
                                  of a flexibility for this kind of a game with the different control scheme based from dark souls 3 and sekiro, both games made by FROMSOFT. the game introduces an array of weapons, armor and enemies, each unique from on another. Combat in this game have
                                combos, unique to each weapon class with some outliers from the rest. The story in this game goes deeper than roots in the ground, as there are locations where you need to go only for reaching certain endings, some are not required to get the initial ending.
                                the bosses in the game feature an even more difficult moveset from the earlier games with each moves are fluid with each change in movement from the bosses. There are some elegant and beautiful like a cluster of galaxies and some intimidating and gives off a
                                feeling of danger the moment they set their eyes on you. The multiplayer in this game feels better than how it was in Dark Souls 3 as there are more options to play and fight against other players in the open world.
                              <br><br> The game may give you a total amount of playtime of 40 hours atleast, which of course depends with how you approach the game, and fight bosses and mobs. The game is highly entertaining and replayability is high with the assorment of weapons and builds
                                the game offers the player.</p>

                                <p>stealth maybe not fun at certain times, but this game delivers it well. MGS V is a game from a long standing series of stealth focused games. the game starts of slow in the tutorial phase of the game, after that you can do whatever you like in the open world
                                  set in a fictional 1984 Afghanistan valley. The stealth in this game feels better than how it can be in other games such as Farcry and Assasins Creed. it does not feel slow as there are multiple factors a player may consider when trying to infiltrate an outpost. you have an assorment of companions to choose and base your playstyle around. the enemy
                                  can call for reinforcements, adapt to your playstyle and create an even more challenge when sneaking into an outpost. the combat in this game feels just right as you role play as the master of stealth, venom snake. Each injury you take makes you feel as you are in that situation, you may lose accuracy and the use of 2 handed weapons when you get shot in your arm, mobility lessen
                                  if you are shot in the leg. The story in this game feels convuluted if this is your first game in the series as the game starts in the middle of other games, so you may miss out on some easter eggs, context and important lore. There is a feature where you manage your homebase by bringing back 
                                  materials, equipment and men which basically is a base building side feature of the game which does not need entierly your attention as it is mostly passive with some exceptions.<br><br> 
                                  overall, the game has high replayability, the greatest story out of all games on the list, good soundtrack with music from the 80's, and great gameplay in general. my only gripe with the game is how much context you miss with the story, and it is a deep rabbit hole when you delve deeper in the lore of the game.
